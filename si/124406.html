              <ul/>
    </div>
                  <p class="explanation">Before inspecting for intermittents, perform the diagnostic system check-passive entry and start system and verify whether all of the following conditions are met. <br/>No DTCs are detected <br/>Scan tool data is within the range of normal values</p>
                      <div class="supplement">
        <p>Note</p>
        <ul>
                      <li>Visual inspection</li>
              <ul/>
    </div>
                  <p class="explanation">Some of the failure repair procedures require careful visual and physical inspection. This step is extremely important. Problems may be able to be repaired just by carrying out visual and physical inspections, which leads to saving valuable time. Ensure that: <br/>The PESS control unit grounds are clean, tight, and in their proper location <br/>The PESS control unit harness wiring and terminals are properly connected and are not pinched or cut</p>
                      <div class="supplement">

        <ul>
                      <li>Intermittent</li>
              <ul/>
    </div>
                  <p class="explanation">If an intermittent condition exists, inspect for improper installation of electrical components. Inspect any aftermarket add-on electrical devices, lights, and mobile phones. Check that no aftermarket equipment is connected to the serial data circuit. If an intermittent condition cannot be identified, communication signals of mobile phones may be causing the symptom. <br/>Even if a problem occurs, most intermittent conditions are caused by faulty electrical connections or wiring. Carefully inspect a suspect connector visually and physically for the following conditions.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Improper connection of connectors<br/>Loosening of terminals<br/>Damaged or improperly formed terminals</p>
          <p class="explanation">Repair or replace connector terminals in the problem circuit in order to ensure proper contact tension. Remove the terminal from the connector body in order to inspect for a poor terminal-to-wire connection.<br/>Connect the DMM to the circuit suspected for an abnormality, and perform a road test for the vehicle. An abnormal reading that occurs when the malfunction occurs is a good indication that there is a malfunction in the circuit being monitored.</p>
          <p class="explanation">If the intermittent problem exists from the start and continues, test DTCs related to the vehicle theft deterrent system. Test for improper installation of electric components such as lights and cellular phones.<br/>When any of the followings is the cause, DTC is not stored.</p>
          <p class="explanation">There is a loose or dirty PESS control unit ground. <br/>Electronic system interference generated by relay or switch malfunction exists.<br/>These electronic components may generate large electronic surges. <br/>Normally, this problem will occur when the malfunctioning component is operating. <br/>Open diodes</p>
          <p class="explanation">The following diagnosis shows possible causes for each symptom. The order of these procedures is not important. <br/>If there are no abnormalities in the scan tool readings, proceed in a logical order, starting with items that are easiest to check, or those that are most likely.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The problem is not currently present but is indicated in DTC History. Or, there is a customer complaint, but the symptom cannot currently be reproduced because the problem is not DTC related.</p>
                      <div class="supplement">
        <p>Note</p>
        <ul>
                      <li>Preliminary inspection</li>
              <ul/>
    </div>
                  <p class="explanation">Before starting the inspection, perform the required preliminary inspections and visual inspection.</p>
                      <div class="supplement">
        <p>Note</p>
        <ul>
                      <li>Harness and connector</li>
              <ul/>
    </div>
                  <p class="explanation">Many intermittent open or shorted circuits are affected by harness/connector movement caused by vibration, engine torque, bumps/rough road surface or the like. Test for this type of condition by performing the applicable procedure from the following list. <br/>Move related connectors and wiring while monitoring the applicable scan tool data. <br/>While commanding components ON and OFF using the scan tool, move related connectors and wiring and monitor component operation. <br/>With the engine running, move related connectors and wiring while monitoring engine operation. If harness or connector movement affects the displayed data, component/system operation, or engine operation, inspect and repair the harness or connectors as necessary.</p>
                      <div class="supplement">
        <p>Note</p>
        <ul>
                      <li>Electrical connection or wiring</li>
              <ul/>
    </div>
                  <p class="explanation">Defective electrical connections, loose terminals or wiring problems cause most intermittent failures. Perform the following inspections:</p>
          <p class="explanation">Inspect for improper mating of the connector halves, or terminals improperly seated in the connector body. <br/>Inspect for improperly formed or damaged terminals. Test for poor terminal tension. Inspect for improper terminal to wire connections including terminals bent by the insulation. This requires removing the terminal from the connector body. <br/>Inspect for corrosion/water intrusion. Wear or damage on the insulation can allow moisture to enter the wiring. The conductor can corrode inside the insulation, with little visible evidence. Look for swollen and stiff sections of wire in the suspect circuits. <br/>Inspect for wires that are broken inside the insulation. <br/>Inspect the harness for wire pinching, open circuits, or wear. <br/>Ensure that the wiring does not come in contact with hot exhaust components.</p>
                      <div class="supplement">
        <p>Note</p>
        <ul>
                      <li>Control Unit Power Supply and Ground/Component Power Supply and Ground</li>
              <ul/>
    </div>
                  <p class="explanation">Poor power supply or ground connections can cause widely varying symptoms. <br/>Test all control unit power supply circuits. Many vehicles have multiple circuits supplying power to the control unit. Other components in the system have separate power supply circuits that also need to be tested. Inspect connections at the unit, component connectors, fuses, and any other intermediate connections between the power supply, unit, and component. A test lamp or a DMM is capable of indicating whether or not any voltage is present, but neither of them has the ability to test whether sufficient current is flowing in the circuit. Ensure that the circuit can carry the current necessary to operate the components. <br/>Test all control unit and system ground circuits. The control unit may have multiple ground circuits. Other components in the system have separate grounds that also need to be tested. Inspect the ground points for contamination or improper tightening. Inspect the connections at the component and in splice packs where applicable. Ensure that the circuit can carry the current necessary to operate the components.</p>
                      <div class="supplement">
        <p>Note</p>
        <ul>
                      <li>Temperature sensitivity</li>
              <ul/>
    </div>
                  <p class="explanation">Intermittent conditions may occur when the components or connections reach their operating temperature. For intermittent conditions that may occur only when the components or connections are cold, or only when they are hot, failure records or snapshot data can be helpful, where possible.</p>
          <p class="explanation">If an intermittent condition is related to heat, review the data relating to the following items: <br/>High outside air temperature <br/>Heat emitted from the circuits due to defective connections or high loads <br/>If an intermittent condition is related to low temperatures, review the data relating to the following items: <br/>Low outside air temperature <br/>In extremely low temperatures, ice may form in a connection or component. Test whether there has been water intrusion. <br/>This condition only occurs in a cold start. <br/>It does not occur after the vehicle has been warmed up. <br/>Based on the information from the customer, determine if the failure is caused by temperature.</p>
                      <div class="supplement">
        <p>Note</p>
        <ul>
                      <li>EMI and electrical noise</li>
              <ul/>
    </div>
                  <p class="explanation">Some electronic components and circuits are sensitive to EMI or other types of electrical noise. Inspect for the following conditions. <br/>Harnesses are placed too close to high-voltage or high-current devices such as injection components, motors, or generators. These components may generate electrical noises which interfere with normal circuit operations. <br/>Electrical system interference caused by a malfunctioning relay, solenoid, or switch. Such interference may cause a large electrical surge to be generated. Normally, this problem will occur when the malfunctioning component is operating. <br/>Improper installation of non-factory or aftermarket electronic equipment such as lights, two-way radios, amplifiers, electric motors, remote starters, alarm systems, and mobile phones. Electromagnetic disturbance may occur while this electronic equipment is in use, but not when not in use. <br/>Test for an open diode. There may be a bent diode in the relay. <br/>Test the generator for a malfunctioning rectifier bridge that may be allowing A/C noise into the electrical system.</p>
                      <div class="supplement">
        <p>Note</p>
        <ul>
                      <li>Duplicating failure conditions</li>
              <ul/>
    </div>
                  <p class="explanation">If none of the previous tests are successful, attempt to duplicate and/or record the failure conditions. <br/>An alternate method is to drive the vehicle with the DMM connected to a suspected circuit. An abnormal reading on the DMM when the problem occurs may help you locate the problem.</p>
                      <div class="supplement">
        <p>Note</p>
        <ul>
                      <li>Snapshot of the scan tool</li>
              <ul/>
    </div>
                  <p class="explanation">The scan tool can be set up to take a snapshot of the parameters available via serial data. <br/>The snapshot function records live data in chronological order. The recorded data can be replayed and analyzed. The scan tool also has a graph function which can be used to graph parameters individually or in combination with other parameters for comparison. The snapshot can be triggered manually at the time the symptom is noticed or set up in advance to be triggered when a DTC sets. An abnormal value captured in the recorded data may point to a system or component that needs to be investigated further.</p>
