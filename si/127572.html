          <p class="explanation">System diagnosis method<br/>The system diagnosis method is a standardized method to repair all electronic control systems. The diagnostic procedure is always used to solve problems with the electronic control systems, and is the starting point in the event of a repair is required. The following steps indicate how to proceed through the diagnosis.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Confirm the customer complaint.<br/>In order to confirm the customer complaint, the person performing the diagnosis for the vehicle must know how the system normally operates.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Perform a preliminary inspection.<br/>Perform overall visual inspection, and review the maintenance history, and detect problems such as abnormal sounds and odors, collect DTC information.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Check for a related Service Bulletin.</p>
          <p class="explanation">When a DTC has been recorded<br/>Accurately perform the repair according to the specified DTC chart.</p>
          <p class="explanation">If no DTC is stored<br/>Select the symptom from the Symptom. Complete the repair according to the diagnostic procedure. It is also possible to perform the inspection by referring to the Functional Inspection.</p>
          <p class="explanation">When a relevant symptom is not found<br/>Examine the complaint in detail.<br/>Create a diagnosis plan.<br/>Utilize the wiring diagram and operation principles.<br/>If you can obtain repair history for similar cases, request technical assistance. Combine technical knowledge and effective utilization of available service information.</p>
                      <div class="notice">
        <p>Caution</p>
        <ul>
                      <li>When performing maintenance of the SRS, do not use electrical testers other than those specified in this manual in order to prevent injury due to unnecessary deployment.</li>
              <ul/>
    </div>
                  <p class="explanation">Diagnosis procedure<br/>The diagnosis procedure used in this section aims to detect SRS problems and repair them. The procedure for quickly detecting SRS problems and effectively repairing is as follows. Not following this procedure with thorough caution may result in a longer diagnostic time, incorrect diagnosis, or replacement of incorrect parts. <br/>Perform a preliminary inspection. <br/>The following inspections must be always performed as the start of a diagnosis. <br/>Overall visual inspection Inspection for poor connections in terminals and wires and for evidence of contact with water on the SRS control unitReviewing the maintenance historyDetection of abnormal noises or abnormal odor</p>
          <p class="explanation">Perform Diagnostic system check-SRS controls. <br/>The Diagnostic system check-SRS controls inspection is performed to check whether the SRS airbag warning light works properly, to confirm the code display by the blinking of the SRS airbag warning light, and to check for DTCs using a scan tool. <br/>Refer to an appropriate diagnosis chart according to instructions given by the Diagnostic system check-SRS controls. <br/>After the Diagnostic system check-SRS controls, go to the appropriate chart for the diagnosis of the problem. Skipping these procedures may result in a longer diagnostic time, incorrect diagnosis, or replacement of incorrect parts. <br/>Repeat the Diagnostic system check-SRS controls after conducting repairs or carrying out the diagnosis procedure. <br/>It is possible to confirm whether repairs have been performed properly and whether there are any other problems by performing the Diagnostic system check-SRS controls after conducting any repairs or diagnosis procedures.</p>
          <p class="explanation">DTC<br/>The SRS control unit records the DTC detected after past DTC were last cleared.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Required basic knowledge<br/>A certain level of the basic knowledge is required before using the workshop manual. Without this basic knowledge, there may be difficulties in using the diagnosis procedure in this section. Be careful not to perform harmful operations and prevent unnecessary deployment. Read and understand all of the precautions in the workshop manual as well as on the warning labels attached to SRS parts.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Basic electrical circuits<br/>It is necessary to understand basic theories on electricity, including serial and parallel circuits, and a voltage drop in a series resistor. It is also necessary to understand the meanings of voltage, current, and resistance, and what happens in the circuit if an open wire or short circuit occurs. Make sure to read and understand the wiring diagram.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Procedure to read DTCs<br/>All codes can be read, or all codes excluding some codes can be cleared by using a scan tool.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Method for clearing the DTC<br/>Repair the SRS circuit if there is any failure. <br/>DTCs can be cleared with a scan tool when the problem in the SRS circuit is removed and the SRS returns to a normal condition. <br/>If DTC B0052, B0053, B0055, B0056, B1005, B1008, B1009, B1101 or B101D is set, the SRS control unit must be replaced because the memory cannot be cleared.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Inspection standards in repairing the SRS airbag system<br/>When a collision occurs<br/>When any type of collisions has occurred regardless of whether the SRS airbag has been deployed.<br/>When trouble occurs<br/>When the SRS airbag warning light does not turn on, or a DTC is detected in the diagnosis with the scan tool when the warning light remains turned on.</p>

                <p class="explanation">Flash code diagnosis<br/>The flash code diagnosis of the SRS airbag warning light can be performed by short-circuiting pin 13 and pin 4 or pin 5 of the DLC and turning the ignition switch ON. The SRS control unit displays flush codes by making the SRS airbag warning light blink.<br/>The light is always turned off initially for the first 1.2 seconds of the blinking mode, and then the code 12 is displayed by blinking. The intermission time between the lighting time and the light-off time, the tens place digit and ones place digit, and faults are 0.4 seconds, 1.2 seconds, and 3.2 seconds, respectively. If there are multiple DTCs, each code is displayed 3 times.<br/>If all codes are displayed, all lamps keep blinking continuously until the short circuit between pin 13 and pin 4 or pin 5 of the DLC is removed. There are two special codes (code 12 and code 13) used to read the flash code. Code 12 indicates that the warning light is in the blinking mode. If there is no present code or past code, the SRS control unit displays code 12 until the short circuit between pin 13 and pin 4 or pin 5 of the DLC is removed. Code 13 is displayed if there is a history code, or if a history code other than the current code exists. The scan tool is required to read a history code. In this case, leave the circuit between pin 13 and pin 4 or pin 5 of the DLC open.</p>
          <p class="explanation">When DTCs have been stored<br/>After flash code 12 is displayed once, the stored DTCs are displayed 3 times.<br/>When more than one DTC have been stored, the DTCs are displayed 3 times each in ascending order of DTC number.<br/>After displaying all codes, the codes will be displayed again starting with flash code No.12. This display continues while the DLC is shorted.</p>
