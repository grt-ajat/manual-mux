      <div class="wi-contents">

              <p class="explanation">A typical common rail system is comprised of the following 2 fuel pressure sections. A suction side between the fuel tank and the fuel supply pump, and a high-pressure side between the fuel supply pump and the injectors. <br/>Fuel is drawn from the fuel tank and then pumped into the common rail by two plungers, all of which are internal to the fuel supply pump. <br/>The high pressure is regulated by the ECM using the suction control valve depending on values from the one fuel rail pressure sensor attached to the common rail. <br/>If the common rail pressure becomes excessive, the common rail pressure limiter valve opens to release excessive pressure and return the fuel into the fuel tank.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Use the fuel system check, the service technician performs the appropriate fuel system check.<br/>The fuel system check assumes the following conditions are met:<br/>The battery is completely charged and terminals are cleaned and tight.<br/>The engine cranking speed is normal.<br/>There is adequate fuel in the fuel tank.<br/>There is no air in the fuel line.<br/>Fuse and slow blow fuse are normal.</p>
                      <div class="supplement">
        <p>Note</p>
        <ul>
                      <li>The fuel system from the fuel tank to the fuel supply pump comes loose with the engine running. As a result, air can enter the fuel system if these connections are not tight. Air in the fuel system will cause fuel rail pressure fluctuations especially at high engine speed and load.</li>
                    <li>If the fuel tank is empty or near empty, air may get into the fuel system. <br/>With air in the fuel system, the smooth flow of fuel into the supply pump is restricted and a DTC may set. Bleed the fuel system after refilling.</li>
