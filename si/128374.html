              <ul/>
    </div>
                  <p class="explanation">Before starting the intermittent inspections, perform diagnostic system check-transmission controls to ensure that the following conditions are met.<br/>The TCM and the check trans warning light operate properly.<br/>Any DTC has not been detected.<br/>The scan tool data is within the normal range.</p>
                      <div class="supplement">

        <ul>
                      <li>Visual inspection</li>
              <ul/>
    </div>
                  <p class="explanation">Some of the symptom repair procedures require careful visual and physical inspections. This step is extremely important. Problems may be corrected just by carrying out the visual and physical inspections without performing any further inspections, which leads to the saving of valuable time. Confirm the following points.<br/>The TCM grounds are clean, tight, and in the proper location.<br/>The transmission harness wiring and terminals are properly connected without a pinching or open circuit.</p>
                      <div class="supplement">
        <p>Note</p>
        <ul>
                      <li>Intermittent</li>
              <ul/>
    </div>
                  <p class="explanation">If an intermittent condition exists, inspect for improper installation of electrical components. Inspect aftermarket add-on electrical equipment devices, lights, and mobile phones. Confirm that no commercial equipment is connected to the serial data circuit. If an intermittent condition cannot be located, communication signal of a mobile phone may be causing the condition.<br/>Even when the problem occurs, the check trans warning light does not always blink or a DTC is not always stored. In most cases, a faulty electrical connection or wiring is causing an intermittent failure. Perform careful visual and physical inspections on the connector that is suspected to have an abnormality for the following conditions.</p>
          <p class="explanation">Improper connection of the connector<br/>Looseness of the terminal<br/>Damaged or improperly formed terminal</p>
          <p class="explanation">Repair or replace the connector terminals in the problematic circuit in order to ensure that the connect pressure is appropriate. Remove the terminals from the connector body in order to inspect for improper connection between the terminals and the wires.<br/>Connect the DMM to the circuit suspected for an abnormality, and perform a road test for the vehicle. An abnormal reading that occurs when a malfunction happens indicates that there is an abnormality in the circuit being monitored.</p>
          <p class="explanation">If the intermittent problem exists from the start and continues, test DTCs related to the vehicle theft deterrent system. Test for improper installation of electric components such as lights and mobile phones.</p>
          <p class="explanation">When any of the following is the cause, a DTC is not stored, but the check trans warning light turns ON intermittently.</p>
          <p class="explanation">The TCM grounds are loose or dirty.<br/>The check trans warning light circuit is intermittently having a short circuit to the ground.<br/>Electrical system interference caused by malfunctions in the relay, TCM driven solenoid, or switch. These electrical components can cause a large electrical surge. Normally, the problem occurs when the malfunctioning component operates.<br/>There is a diode with an open circuit.</p>
          <p class="explanation">In the diagnosis, possible causes for each symptom are indicated. The order of these procedures is not important. If no abnormality is seen on the scan tool readings, proceed in a logical order, starting with items that are easiest to inspect, or those that are most likely.</p>

                      <li>Harness and connector</li>
              <ul/>
    </div>
                  <p class="explanation">Many of the circuits that are intermittently having an open circuit or short circuit are often affected by the movements of harnesses and connectors due to vibrations, engine torque, bumps, rough pavements, etc. Test for this type of condition by performing the applicable procedure from the following list.<br/>Move the related connectors and wiring while monitoring the relevant scan tool data.<br/>Move the related connectors and wiring, and observe the operation of the component while commanding ON and OFF to the component with the scan tool.<br/>With the engine running, move related connectors and wiring while monitoring engine operation.<br/>When moving the harness or connector affects the data display, component/system operation or engine operation, inspect and repair the harness or connectors as necessary.</p>

              <ul/>
    </div>
                  <p class="explanation">In most of cases, a poor electrical connection, loosened terminal or wiring problem causes an intermittent condition. Perform the following inspections.<br/>Inspect for poor mating of the connector halves, or terminals improperly seated in the connector body.<br/>Inspect for improperly formed or damaged terminals. Test for a loosened terminal.<br/>Inspect for poor terminal to wire connections including terminals bent by insulation. This requires removing the terminal from the connector body.<br/>Inspect for corrosion and water intrusion. Worn or damaged insulation can allow moisture to enter the wiring. The conductor can corrode inside the insulation, with little visible evidence. Check for any swollen or stiff section of the wire in the circuit suspected for an abnormality.<br/>Inspect for wires that are broken inside the insulation.<br/>Inspect the harness for a pinching caused by wiring, disconnection and worn.<br/>Confirm that the wiring does not come in contact with a hot exhaust component.</p>
                      <div class="supplement">
        <p>Note</p>
        <ul>
                      <li>The power supply and ground of the control unit, the power supply and ground of the components</li>
              <ul/>
    </div>
                  <p class="explanation">Poor power or ground connections can cause widely varying symptoms.<br/>Test all control unit power supply circuits. Many vehicles have multiple circuits supplying power to the control unit. Other components in the system have separate power supply circuits, and they also need to be tested. Inspect connections of the unit, component connectors or fuses, and other intermediate connections between the power source and the unit, and between components. A test light or the DMM is capable of indicating whether or not any voltage is present, but neither of them has the ability to test whether sufficient current is flowing in the circuit. Confirm whether the circuit can secure the current necessary to operate the components.<br/>Test all of the ground circuits for the control unit and the system. The control unit may have multiple ground circuits. Other components in the system have separate grounds, and they also need to be tested. Inspect the ground points for contamination and improper tightening. Inspect the connections of the components, and those in splice packs, where applicable. Confirm whether the circuit can secure the current necessary to operate the components.</p>
                      <div class="supplement">
        <p>Note</p>
        <ul>
                      <li>Temperature sensitivity</li>
              <ul/>
    </div>
                  <p class="explanation">An intermittent condition may occur when a component or connection reaches its operating temperature. For an intermittent condition that may occur only when the component or connection is cold, or only when it is hot, failure records or snapshot data can be helpful, where possible.<br/>If an intermittent condition is related to heat, review the data relating to the following items.<br/>High outside air temperature<br/>Heat emitted under the cab or by the engine<br/>Heat emitted from a circuit due to a defective connection or high load<br/>Load condition higher than normal, such as when towing<br/>If an intermittent condition is related to low temperature, review the data relating to the following items.<br/>Low outside air temperature.<br/>In an extremely low temperature, ice may form in a connection or component. Test for water intrusion.<br/>This condition only occurs for a cold start.<br/>It does not occur after the vehicle has been warmed up.<br/>Based on the information from the customer, determine if the failure is caused by temperature.</p>
                      <div class="supplement">
        <p>Note</p>
        <ul>
                      <li>EMI and electrical noise</li>
              <ul/>
    </div>
                  <p class="explanation">Some electrical components and circuits are sensitive to EMI or other types of electrical noises. Inspect for the following conditions.<br/>Whether the harnesses are placed too close to the high-voltage or high-current devices such as injection components, motors, generators, etc. These components may generate electrical noises which interfere with normal circuit operations.<br/>Electrical system interference caused by a malfunction of relay, TCM driven solenoid, or switch. This may cause a large electrical surge to be generated. Normally, the problem occurs when the malfunctioning component operates.<br/>Improper installation of non-factory or commercial electronic equipment such as lights, 2-way radios, amplifiers, electric motors, remote starters, alarm systems, mobile phones, etc. Electromagnetic disturbance may occur while these electronic equipment are in use, but not while they are not in use.<br/>Test for any diode with an open circuit. Some relays may contain a bent diode.<br/>Test the generator for a malfunctioning rectifier bridge that may be allowing A/C noises into the electrical system.</p>
                      <div class="supplement">
        <p>Note</p>
        <ul>
                      <li>Duplicating failure conditions</li>
              <ul/>
    </div>
                  <p class="explanation">If none of the above tests are successful, try to duplicate and record the failure condition.<br/>An alternate method is to drive the vehicle with the DMM connected to a suspected circuit. An abnormal reading on the DMM when the problem occurs, may help you locate the problem.</p>
                      <div class="supplement">
        <p>Note</p>
        <ul>
                      <li>Snapshot of the scan tool</li>
              <ul/>
    </div>
                  <p class="explanation">The scan tool can obtain snapshots of the parameters available via the serial data. The snapshot function records live data over a period of time. The recorded data can be replayed and analyzed. The scan tool also has the graphing function, and can graph a parameter alone or in combination with other parameters for comparison. The snapshot can be triggered manually at the time the symptom is noticed, or set up in advance to be triggered when a DTC sets. An abnormal value captured in the recorded data may point a system or component that needs to be investigated further.</p>
